Input Format
First line: Number of Test Cases T and then follows their description
For each test case, first row indicate N s (single space separated) where N is number of vertices in directed graph where vertices are labelled 1 to N and s is the index of source vertex
Second row mentions the number of edges M
And then M rows mentioning  u v w(u,v)

 Output Format desired is:
T rows corresponding to T test cases 
Output row for each test case has 2N+1+1 entries (all single space separated)
where first entry is the  total sum of min cost arborescence 
and then N entries corresponding to vertices V1, V2, V3..., VN providing the distance of i-th vertex from the source vertex s. (Indicate -1 if unreachable)
and then Symbol #
and then N entries (corresponding to vertices V1, V2, V3..., VN) providing the label of the parent node through which one reaches i-th vertex (basically second last node in path from source vertex to that i-th vertex. (Indicate 0 if no parent i.e. for source vertex and -1 if vertex i not reachable)

Considering this, the output  would be as follows
